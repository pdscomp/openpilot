Onroad orchestration for the AlphaLongitudinalEnabled toggle and force-offroad.

The alpha-long param is read once at fingerprint, so applying a change requires an
onroad cycle. The UI only writes the param; card owns the cycle request so brands that
silence a stock ECU can hand it back first. pandad blocks TX within ~100 ms of
`started` dropping, which makes any shutdown-time deinit impossible: the hand-back
must finish before the cycle is requested (docs/mazda-alpha-long-setup-teardown.md).

Force-offroad ("Always Offroad") gets the same treatment: the UI writes
OffroadModeRequested and card grants OffroadMode once the hand-back completes.
Dropping straight to offroad mid-drive leaves the radar to recover through its ~5 s
S3 timeout, and a radar that comes back that way mid-drive re-enters the bus in a
degraded state: the body ECU then cycles MRCC availability (PEDALS.ACC_OFF flapping,
CRZ_CTRL fault payloads) until the next ignition cycle, blocking cruise engagement
(route 0000003a). hardwared grants the request directly when there is no onroad
session to hand back from, or if card does not finish in time.

For Mazda op-long the hand-back sequence is: assert CarControlSP.stockEcuHandBack
-> carcontroller stops tester present and requests the radar's default session while
keeping synthetic frames flowing -> the stock radar's CRZ_INFO returns (carstate
raises accFaulted, its "stock radar heard" two-master guard) -> take the action.
If the session request is lost the radar still recovers via its ~5 s S3 timeout,
which the timeout below outwaits.
